# Codename Sound Files

Place the following MP3 sound files in this directory:

- `correct.mp3` - Played when team reveals their own card (positive sound)
- `wrong_team.mp3` - Played when team reveals opponent's card (negative sound)
- `neutral.mp3` - Played when revealing a neutral card (subtle sound)
- `assassin.mp3` - Played when hitting the assassin (dramatic game over sound)
- `victory.mp3` - Played when a team wins the game (celebration sound)
- `turn_change.mp3` - Played when turn switches to the other team (transition sound)

Recommended: Keep files short (1-3 seconds) for better UX.
